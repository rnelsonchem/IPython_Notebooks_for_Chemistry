When the two square waves are directly overlapping, the resulting function will have twice the intensity. We could get the picture shown if one of the waves was normalized by its integrated area."

Rotating this 1D vector (using the [*reshape*](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.reshape.html#numpy.ndarray.reshape) method) creates a [n,1] 2D array. For our Gaussian function above, when using an [n,1] 2D array for the x values and [m,] length vectors for the height, width, and positional variables an [n, m] 2D array is returned with each column representing a different Gaussian function over the given wavelength range.

      "To see the effects of convolution on this spectrum, consider the simple spectrometer shown below. Rotation of the grating angle allows light of different wavelengths to interact with the sample. Monitoring the detector response relative to grating angle, which is directly related to wavelength, gives us an absorbance spectrum. In theory, the slit should be infinately thin, so that only a single wavelength of light is passing through the sample at any given time. This ensures that Beer's Law ( A = &#949;bC ) is always valid and that the resulting linewidth will be the natural linewidth for the particular transition.\n",

Our slit width will be in nanometers, so in order to match that up with our wavelength axis, we need to calculate how many points that relates to based on our wavelength resolution.
