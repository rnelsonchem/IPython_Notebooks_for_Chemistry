      "For a continuous signal, the [Fourier transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) (FT, Equation 1) is simply the integral of a time-domain (complex) function, $f(t)$, multiplied by an imaginary exponential function.\n",

      "\n",
      "There are two things to keep in mind here. First of all, the frequency term in the exponential is equivalent to radians (Equation 2). Also, an exponential of an imaginary number can be expanded by [Euler's Formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula) (Equation 3).\n",

      "\n",
      "For functions that are easily integrable and infinite, this equation can be solved exactly. However, in most real situations (such as a spectroscopic signal) this time domain function is a very complex, finite signal that can not be easily integrated. In this case, we need to use a [Discrete Fourier Transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform) (Equation 5).\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\mathrm{Equation\\ 5:}\\ \\ \\ F( \\nu_{m} ) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_{n} e^{- i 2 \\pi n m / N}$$\n",

      "Fortunately, efficient computational alogrithms were determined for equation many years ago and are collectively known as [Fast Fourier Transformations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) (FFT). It is not an overstatement to say that these algorithms revolutionized spectrocopic methods. \n",
