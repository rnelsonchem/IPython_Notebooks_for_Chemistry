      "For a continuous signal, the [Fourier transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) (FT, Equation 1) is simply the integral of a time-domain (complex) function, $f(t)$, multiplied by an imaginary exponential function.\n",

      "$$\\mathrm{Equation\\ 1:}\\ \\ \\ F( \\nu ) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} f(t) e^{- i 2 \\pi \\nu t} \\mathrm{d}t$$\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two things to keep in mind here. First of all, the frequency term in the exponential is equivalent to radians (Equation 2). Also, an exponential of an imaginary number can be expanded by [Euler's Formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula) (Equation 3).\n",

      "\n",
      "For functions that are easily integrable and infinite, this equation can be solved exactly. However, in most real situations (such as a spectroscopic signal) this time domain function is a very complex, finite signal that can not be easily integrated. In this case, we need to use a [Discrete Fourier Transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform) (Equation 5).\n",
      "\n",
      "$$\\mathrm{Equation\\ 5:}\\ \\ \\ F( \\nu_{m} ) = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_{n} e^{- i 2 \\pi n m / N}$$\n",

The Numpy inverse transforms all begin with 'i', so [*ifft*](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.fft.ifft.html) will reverse our FT from before. However, the FT and its reverse are both complex transformations. Even though we started with purely real data, the reverse may give some small amount of imaginary data as well because of floating point errors.
