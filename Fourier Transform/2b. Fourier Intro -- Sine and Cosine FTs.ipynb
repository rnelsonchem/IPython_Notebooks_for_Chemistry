      "Next well use [Numpy's fast Fourier transform routine](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.fft.fft.html) to calculate the Fourier transform (FT) of our simulated spectrum. At this point, notice that this function only requires the intenstiy data (y data) and not the time data (x axis). This is a limitation of the Fourier transform: there is no specific time information in the transformation. In addition, there is an assumption that the data are equally spaced in time! If you have unequally spaced data, you need to either [reinterpolate](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/interpolate.html) the data onto a equally spaced grid or use an alternative method to the FT (e.g. [least squares spectral analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least-squares_spectral_analysis) which is [implemented in Scipy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/signal.html#lomb-scargle-periodograms-spectral-lombscargle)).\n",

Notice, this is also the first instance where any specific time information about our system is being incorporated. Since Numpy uses the original [Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley%E2%80%93Tukey_FFT_algorithm), this frequency ordering is necessary to obtain the symmetric FT array that we saw in our 4 point case in Notebook 2a. \n",

      "Again, let's make a nice dual-wide plot of our FT data using the *dual\\_plot\\_ft* function. The FT is a complex transformation, so the computed results contain both real (left plot) and imaginary (right plot) components. In the case of a pure cosine input wave, the FT does not contain any (appreciable) imagainary components. You may see some small contamination because of the discrete nature of the FFT, but this is the most realistic spectroscopic situation. We've zoomed in substantially on the x axis, because the range of frequencies is very high (you can remove the xmin or xmax values from the plotting function to see how high the frequencies go). \n",
