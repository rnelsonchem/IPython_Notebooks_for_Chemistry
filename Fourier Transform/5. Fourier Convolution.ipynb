      "It turns out that you really only need to know a few different types of functional FTs because the FT and convolution have a very interesting relationship, called the [Convolution Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem).\n",
      "\n",
      "To explore this concept, first let's define a convolution of two functions, *h* and *e* as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "$$f(t)=h(t)*e(t)$$\n",
      "\n",
      "Where the '*' symbol will represent the convolution. The Convolution Theorem states that the FT of the convolved function is equivalent to the product of the FT of *h* and *e*, which we will call *H* and *E* respecively. \n",
      "\n",
      "$$F( \\nu ) = \\mathrm{FT}( f(t) ) = H( \\nu )\\cdot E( \\nu )$$\n",
      "\n",
      "The convolution of two functions in time space can then be calculated by doing the multiplication of the FT of each function followed by an inverse FT on the product. This equality is especially useful in signal processing. It turns out that the convolution operation is extrememly computationally demanding, but a multiplication is trivial. So you can use this relationship to calculate the convolution of two functions much more rapidly. Let's explore this by looking at a couple of simulations.\n",
