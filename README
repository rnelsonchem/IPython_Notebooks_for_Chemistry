These are a series of IPython Notebooks for exploring complex mathematical
concepts in chemistry. The notebooks are organized in folders according to
their area of application.

The very simple Python script 'run_notebook.py' simply starts the notebook
from folder that it is located. This aleviates the need to understand the
command line instructions to get to a particular folder. Just drop a copy of
this script into the desired folder. The method to run the script will be a
little different depending on your OS and installation method. (Try
right-clicking on the icon. There may be an option to "Run with..." where you
can choose the Python interpreter.)

Installation
============

In order to run these Notebooks, you will need to install, at a minimum, the
newest releases of Python 2, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, and IPython with all
their associated dependencies. This can be quite time consuming, but
installation instructions for each package can be found from their respective
websites.

The easiest way to install the necessary packages is to use one of the
prepackeged options for your operating system, such as Python(x,y) 
(Windows), Enthought Python Distribution (all OSes), or Anaconda (all OS,
broken uninstaller for Windows as of v1.2.1).

Some specific installation notes are provided here for reference.
